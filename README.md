# team-profile-generator

// Description //
The application generates a work team based on questions asked by inquirer. It takes this input and creates an html file based off of the answers to each question. It should be noted that while the questions and answers work, the HTML file is not being created.There was also testing done using object oriented programming to ensure correct information.This testing was done using jest.
